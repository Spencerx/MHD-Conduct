Current Status
--------------

This is a first draft of a Code of Conduct for Music Hack Day events, based on
similar codes of conduct, such as the [PyCon Code of Conduct](https://us.pycon.org/2013/about/code-of-conduct/)
and its upstream template from the [Geek Feminism wiki](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Policy) and the [Ada Initiative](http://adainitiative.org/what-we-do/conference-policies/).

Because this is a draft, your comments, criticisms, and feedback are appreciated.
We would like Music Hack Day to be deliberately and specifically open and
welcoming to everyone, and navigating the tech-meets-pop-culture in both an
inclusive and an artistically-friendly way is challenging.

As this is, in its first draft, I am having a particularly hard time figuring
out how to write the last paragraph of the "in depth" section in a way that both
curbs potential harrassment, and also does not prevent someone from building
something like an automatic-playlist-generator based on user input.  Feedback
on that paragraph in particular would be *greatly appreciated*.
